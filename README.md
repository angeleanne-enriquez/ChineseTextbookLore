> High School Project - Winter 2023

## Project Goal
This project aims to explain the characters and their relationships to each other in the "Integrated Chinese: Simplified Characters, Level 1, Part 1" textbook. Using HTML, it is a simple, one-page webpage detailing all of the characters in the textbook. This was a project from my coding club in high school that I had a lot of fun doing, regardless of how rudimentary it is!
